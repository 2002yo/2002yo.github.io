                    <h2>The Tea Museum</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Ceylon Tea Museum at Hantane, three kilometers from Kandy city is served by a motor able
                        road that circles the museum,
                        provides easy access and adequate parking facilities for cars and tourist coaches. The museum
                        consists of four floors.
                        The ground floor and the second floor exhibit very old items of machinery and the first floor
                        consist of a library and an auditorium with facilities for audio visual presentations.
                        The third floor is allocated to tea sales outlets, where a selection of Sri Lanka's fine tea is
                        available. The entire top floor is a tea cafe.
                        A panoramic view of the Kandy town surrounded by the beautiful Hunasgiriya,
                        Knuckles Range and the Matale range of hills can be viewed through a telescope mounted on the
                        fourth floor.
                        The grounds surrounding the Tea Museum are landscaped with different varieties of teas.
                        Kandy is a mandatory stop virtually on every tourist's itinerary and the location of the Ceylon
                        Tea Museum at Hantane enhances the attraction of the hill country to visitors.
                        Additionally, its proximity to the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens and Loolecondera estate,
                        where tea was first grown commercially in Sri Lanka makes Hantane the perfect location.

                        <h2>Co-Founders</h2>
                        <p>
                            James Taylor arrived in Ceylon in 1852, settling down at the Loolecondera Estate, Galaha.
                            He begins a 19-acre tea plantation on the Loolecondera Estate in 1867,
                            laying the foundation for what would become Sri Lanka’s largest export industry for over a
                            century.
                            In 1872, a fully equipped tea factory began operating on the Loolecondera Estate.
                            In 1873, Ceylon Tea made its international debut when twenty-three pounds of tea produced by
                            James Taylor reached London.
                            During the 1880s, tea production in Sri Lanka grew rapidly with planters from all over the
                            hill country.
                            The production and export of green tea started in 1982.
                            <br>
                            In 1999, the Sri Lanka Tea Board globally trademarked the Lion logo as an emblem of 100%
                            Pure Ceylon Tea.
                            2001 saw the setting up of a Tea Museum in an old tea factory in Hanthana, Kandy.
                            In 2002, the Tea Association of Sri Lanka was formed.
                            Sri Lanka also became the first country to be recognized as a producer of Ozone-friendly
                            tea.
                            The year 2017 marked the 150th year of Ceylon Tea. Since James Taylor established the first
                            commercial plantation in 1867, the Sri Lankan tea industry has come a long way, now
                            generating over USD 1 billion in export
                            revenue and employing over 1 million citizens.

                            The library of Ceylon Tea Museum houses a collection of books, periodicals, newspapers,
                            manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, CDs,
                            videotapes and DVDs which provide the visitor a deep insight into the History of Ceylon Tea
                            Industry which ranges from latter part of 1800 to the modern day.
                            Old photographs of tea factories, plantations & planters such as James Taylor, Thomas J
                            Lipton
                            etc. showcase the proud heritage of the Ceylon tea industry.
                            Directories of planter’s information and books such as “100 years of Ceylon tea” make sense
