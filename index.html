                        Sri Lanka is an island made for tea.
                        This was introduced in 1867, Ceylon Tea has grown to be the top agriculture export in Sri Lanka and
                        provides direct and
                        indirect employment to nearly 1 million people while around 4% of the country’s land area is covered
                        in tea plantations amounting to nearly 203000 hectares.
                        The country produces tea throughout the year and the total tea production is about 340 million
                        kilograms per annum. Sri Lanka’s tea-growing areas are mainly concentrated in the central highlands
                        and southern inland areas of the island.
                        Tea grown in these areas are broadly grouped according to their elevations, with high grown tea
                        sourced from tea plantations found from 1200 m upwards; medium grown tea from estates scattered
                        between 600 m to 1200 m and low grown tea from sea level up to 600 m.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        In addition, Sri Lanka’s tea-growing areas are also divided into seven main regions based mainly on
                        the terroir, namely Nuwara Eliya, Uda Pussellawa, Uva, Dimbula, Kandy, Sabaragamuwa, and Ruhuna.
                        Each area produces a uniquely flavored Ceylon Tea,
                        mainly due to the contrasting elevation, climate, and terrain in each region.
                        At present, a larger portion of the country’s tea is exported as Ceylon Black Tea, while the country
                        also produces Ceylon Green Tea, a type developed from Assamese seedlings. Ceylon White Tea, namely
                        silver and golden tips is celebrated around the world for their
                        finest flavor and are among the most expensive tea varieties in the world.

                                <h4><b>THE CHOSEN LEAVES</b> </h4>- The first secret is in the art of plucking. To ensure
                                the excellence of the final product, skilled hands aided by trained eyes pluck only unopened
                                buds accompanied by two leaves sprouting from the springs of each tea bush.

                                <h4><b>THE ROLLING</b> </h4>- Once the withering process is finally through and done, the
                                withered leaves enter the third stage. It’s called rolling. They are fed to rolling machines
                                to break their stubborn cell structures of resistance, to open their hearts and seduce them
                                to release the natural essence contained within.

                                <h4><b>BLOW HOT,COLD</b></h4>- Next, they must go through fermentation, the process of
                                oxidation; exposed to air which will brown them to a perfect tan. Then after being blown
                                cold they must be blown hot. They must go through the furnace of fire, pass through a
                                chamber of hot air, and emerge with the mettle of their flavor tried, tested and proven.
                                It’s this that will set them apart.

                                separately to be presented to the world as the pride of Ceylon Tea: the enchantment that
                                will fill your cup.
